<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Projects

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://www.project.codetru.io)

We make so many different styles of applications. Most on the web, the ones that run locally are usually just to grow our portfolio.

Here's why:
* There are so many things that can be made in this day of age, so why not make it yours.
* Creating applications ranging from displaying information, to an online store, and even a social media site.
* Looking at what we have made can help you dicide.



### Built With
Since we at Codetru make so many different type of applications we decided to list a few frameworks that we use.
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
* [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/)
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

### Prerequisites

Since we do not make many local applications there is no need to ever install any resources on your device. :smile:
